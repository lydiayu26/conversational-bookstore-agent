Emphasis is\\nput on ease of use, performance, documentation, and API cons istency. It has minimal dependen-\\ncies and is distributed under the simpliﬁed BSD license, enc ouraging its use in both academic\\nand commercial settings. Source code, binaries, and docume ntation can be downloaded from\\nhttp://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net .\\nKeywords: Python, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, mode l selection\\n1. Introduction\\nThe Python programming language is establishing itself as one of the most popu lar languages for\\nscientiﬁc computing. Thanks to its high-level interactive nature and its maturing ecosystem of sci-\\nentiﬁclibraries,itisanappealingchoiceforalgorithmicdevelopmentandexp loratorydataanalysis\\n(Dubois, 2007; Milmann and Avaizis, 2011). Yet, as a general-purpose language, it is increasingly\\nusednotonlyinacademic settingsbutalsoinindustry.\\nScikit-learn harnessesthisrichenvironmenttoprovidestate-of-the-artimplementations ofmany\\nwell known machine learning algorithms, while maintaining an easy-to-use interf ace tightly inte-\\ngrated with the Python language. This answers the growing need for statistic al data analysis by\\nnon-specialists in the software and web industries, as well as in ﬁelds outsid e of computer-science,\\nsuch as biology or physics. Scikit-learn differs from other machine learning toolboxes in Python\\nfor various reasons: i)it is distributed under the BSD license ii)it incorporates compiled code for\\nefﬁciency, unlike MDP (Zito et al., 2008) and pybrain (Schaul et al., 201 0),iii)it depends only on\\nnumpyandscipytofacilitateeasydistribution,unlikepymvpa(Hankeetal.,200 9)thathasoptional\\ndependencies such as R and shogun, and iv)it focuses on imperative programming, unlike pybrain\\nwhich uses a data-ﬂow framework. While the package is mostly written in Python , it incorporates\\ntheC++librariesLibSVM(ChangandLin,2001)andLibLinear(Fanetal., 2008)thatprovideref-\\nerence implementations of SVMs and generalized linear models with compatible licen ses.

ProjectVision\\nCode quality. Rather than providing as many features as possible, the project’s goal ha s been to\\nprovide solid implementations. Code quality is ensured with unit tests—as of relea se 0.8, test\\ncoverage is 81%—and the use of static analysis tools such as pyflakes andpep8. Finally, we\\nstrive to use consistent naming for the functions and parameters used thro ughout a strict adherence\\ntothePythoncoding guidelines andnumpystyledocumentation.\\nBSD licensing.

UnderlyingTechnologies\\nNumpy:the base data structure used for data and model parameters. Input data is presented as\\nnumpy arrays, thus integrating seamlessly with other scientiﬁc Python libraries . Numpy’s view-\\nbased memory model limits copies, even when binding with compiled code (Van der Walt et al.,\\n2011). Italsoprovidesbasicarithmeticoperations.\\nScipy:efﬁcient algorithms for linear algebra, sparse matrix representation, spe cial functions and\\nbasicstatisticalfunctions.

The other important object is the cross-validation iterator ,\\nwhich provides pairs of train and test indices to split input data, for example K-fold, leave one out,\\nor stratiﬁedcross-validation.\\nModel selection. Scikit-learn can evaluate an estimator’s performance or select parameters using\\ncross-validation, optionally distributing the computation to several cores. Th is is accomplished by\\nwrapping an estimator in a GridSearchCV object, where the “CV” stands for “cross-validated”.\\nDuring the call tofit, it selects the parameters on a speciﬁed parameter grid, maximizing a score\\n(thescoremethodoftheunderlyingestimator). predict,score,ortransform arethendelegated\\ntothetunedestimator. Thisobjectcanthereforebeusedtransparentlyasa nyotherestimator. Cross\\nvalidation can be made more efﬁcient for certain estimators by exploiting speciﬁ c properties, such\\nas warm restarts or regularization paths (Friedman et al., 2010). This is su pported through special\\nobjects, such as theLassoCV. Finally, aPipeline object can combine several transformers and\\nan estimator to create a combined estimator to, for example, apply dimension reduc tion before\\nﬁtting. It behaves as a standard estimator, and GridSearchCV therefore tune the parameters of all\\nsteps.\\n5.

Conclusion\\nScikit-learn exposes a wide variety of machine learning algorithms, both supervised and unsuper-\\nvised, using a consistent, task-oriented interface, thus enabling easy co mparison of methods for a\\ngiven application. Since it relies on the scientiﬁc Python ecosystem, it can ea sily be integrated into\\napplications outside the traditional range of statistical data analysis. Importan tly, the algorithms,\\nimplemented in a high-level language, can be used as building blocks for app roaches speciﬁc to\\na use case, for example, in medical imaging (Michel et al., 2011).
